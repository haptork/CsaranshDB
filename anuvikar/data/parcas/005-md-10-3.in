
Input file for PARCAS MD 


NOTE: THIS RUN USED AN UGLY MOVING ATOM APPROXIMATION.

	
Free format input file - parameters can be in any order, and comments
can be placed freely among them, as long as the parameters hold the
9-characters + "="-sign format. Each number must also be followed
by at least one space (not a tab !!).
